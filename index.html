        <div class="founder-info">
            <p>After a decade of indulging his darkest vices as a nightclub promoter, Scott Harrison spent two years on a hospital ship off the coast of Liberia, saw the effects of dirty water firsthand, and came back to New York City on a mission.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Having seen the effects of dirty water firsthand, Scott turned his full attention to the global water crisis and the (then) 1.1 billion people living without access to clean water. He established a small core team in a tiny Manhattan apartment and created <strong>charity: water</strong>.</p>

    <div class="founder-extra">
        <p>Sixteen years later, with the help of more than 1 million supporters worldwide, charity: water has raised over $740 million and funded over 121,000 water projects in 29 countries. When completed, those projects will provide over 16.9 million people with clean, safe drinking water.</p>

        <h3><span>How do we tackle the water crisis?</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>We work with local experts and community members to find the best sustainable solution in each place where we work, whether it’s a well, a piped system, a BioSand Filter, or a system for harvesting rainwater. And with every water point we fund, our partners coordinate sanitation and hygiene training, and establish a local Water Committee to help keep water flowing for years to come.</p>

        <div class="approach-title">
            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We work with local partners to fund water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs for rural communities around the world. But our work doesn’t stop when construction ends. We remain committed to monitoring, evaluation, and maintenance to ensure that these programs operate sustainably for years to come.</p>

                <h4>Planning</h4>
                <p>Our local partners select water point locations based on a variety of factors like geography, assessment of need, community participation, and long-term sustainability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="approach-row2">
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <p>In addition to the construction process, local partners spend months establishing community buy-in, promoting safe hygiene practices, and building water committee capacity to manage projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="approach-row3">
                <h4>Post-Implementation</h4>
                <p>To ensure that water continues to flow for years to come, we empower local leaders, use strong operations and maintenance structures, collect data on specific WASH indicators, and implement innovative sensor technology.</p>
